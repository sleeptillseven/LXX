# Project Description

The Septuagint (LXX) is the greatest and most ancient translation work known to human kind. This project's primary goal of is to provide a free version of the LXX according to Codex Alexandrinus. In order to achieve this, Swete's Septuagint must be made available first and then the textual critical note must be incorporated into the text in order that Codex Alexandrinus can be reconstructed.

# Verification

The typed text will be checked against existing texts offered by Logos and Accordance, I personally own, as well as the _GNU licensed_ version from [Eliran Wong](https://github.com/eliranwong/LXX-Swete-1930). Due to the nature of the properietary texts I won't include them here.
